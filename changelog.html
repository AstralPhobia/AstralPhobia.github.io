            <h1>V1.4.0.0</h1>
            <h2>New Options:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Added an additional 'Screenshake' setting: 50%, which is now the default</li>
                <li>Added the 'Grab Mode' option, which allows you to use the grab button as a toggle rather than holding it</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Control Rebinding:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Overhauled the control rebinding system, to allow for much more granular and complete rebinding, including menu inputs and more</li>
                <li>Added a bind for Advanced: Crouch Dash</li>
                <li>After a 'Crouch Dash' bind is set, a 'Crouch Dash Mode' option will appear. 'Press' mode crouch dashes when the button is pressed. 'Hold' mode crouch dashes when the button is held and a regular dash button is pressed</li>
                <li>Added binds for Advanced: Directionals for movement- or dashing-only</li>
                <li>The option to reset all controls to defaults must now be held to confirm</li>
                <li>Removed the hard-coded Quick Restart shortcut on gamepads (L + R + Start), because it can now conflict with custom rebinds. You can bind a dedicated Quick Restart button to use this feature</li>
                <li>Control rebinds will be reset to default when you download this update</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Pause Buffering:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Added 0.1s of input buffering on the Pause input</li>
                <li>Fixed game timer freezing during unpause (this adds 0.15s IGT to each unpause compared to before)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Physics and Gameplay Changes:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Madeline now uses the ducking sprite when crouch dashing</li>
                <li>Moved the bottom screen kill zone down 4px</li>
                <li>Fixed a bug where wall jumps from the right side of walls could sometimes not gain the momentum of the wall</li>
                <li>Fixed MoveBlocks giving inconsistent momentum when moving vertically and being steered horizontally</li>
                <li>Added a grace period of 0.01s for gaining horizontal boosts off of explosions by holding the direction you will be sent in at the moment of impact. Examples of explosions are bumpers, puffer fish, and respawning seekers. 0.01s is a single frame at 100% game speed, but because explosion impacts freeze the game for 0.1s, this is effectively a 0.1s grace period.</li>
                <li>Dash corner correction no longer applies if the corner has spikes on top of it</li>
                <li>Dash jump-thru correction no longer applies if the jump-thru has spikes on top of it</li>
                <li>Dash correction checks now use the hurtbox rather than the physicsbox</li>
                <li>Dashes no longer correct below to ground with spikes</li>
                <li>Fixed squish correction putting Madeline in the ducking state while climbing</li>
                <li>Increased Madeline's maximum vertical squish wiggle distance so that all previously-survivable crush scenarios should still be survivable, despite the previous fix</li>
                <li>Fixed squish correction not applying when pushed by fast-moving blocks</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Chapter 9 Level Changes:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Added a spike to Singular 11</li>
                <li>Added cracked tiles and indicators to Power Source Hub</li>
                <li>Added spikes to Power Source 4th Key</li>
                <li>Added a spike to Event Horizon 9</li>
                <li>Restructured Determination 8</li>
                <li>Shifted spikes and electricity, added a refill in Reconciliation 8</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Minor Changes:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Made Ch3 Master Suite Oshiro idle conversation skippable</li>
                <li>Keyboard icons will be used instead of Controller icons, if the keyboard was the last device used</li>
                <li>Reduced High Resolution art asset sizes, as the game doesn't actually draw them at their full resolution. This greatly reduces asset size</li>
                <li>Removed old Binary save file format from when the game first released</li>
                <li>Added some visual hints to the Chapter 4 Heart</li>
                <li>Updated to the latest version of FNA, introducing FNA3D. This means the FNA version can run DirectX on Windows and Metal on Mac</li>
                <li>Changed the depth of the Chapter 4 white block to be behind Madeline when she enters the room</li>
                <li>Added '--graphics [DRIVER]' and '--disable-lateswaptear' to FNA command-line arguments, which corresponds with FNA3D_FORCE_DRIVER and FNA3D_DISABLE_LATESWAPTEAR respectively</li>
                <li>Some minor changes to 3B</li>
                <li>Small tweaks to 7A flag 11</li>

				<li>Reverted ultra changes to pre-beta</li>
				<li>Added a grace period of 0.01s for gaining horizontal boosts off of explosions by holding the direction you will be sent in at the moment of impact.

                <li>Fixed bug where if you started a new file in Russian, and then switched your langauge back to English, the player's name would no longer draw</li>
                <li>Fixed where if you moved too quickly into an adjacent room with a Temple Gate, the gate could close on you</li>
                <li>Fixed some typo's in Simplified Chinese</li>

            <br /><br />

            <h1>V1.2.1.0</h1>
            <h2>Changes and Additions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Breaking Change:</b> The Chapter timer no longer pauses during deaths, cutscenes, and 
                    in-game menus. Previously it was possible to exploit the timer by retrying on some screen 
                    transitions, which we didn't feel was a fun way to play. Unfortunately due to this change 
                    Speedrun times for single-chapters will be cleared. We decided it was best to make this 
                    change now while the game is still early in its speedrun life.</li>
                <li>Menu text does not flash when selected if Photosensitive Mode is enabled</li>
                <li>Quick Restart hint only displays if you go to it through the Menu</li>
                <li>Assist Mode speed option no longer affects the game speed during player deaths or cutscenes</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed thread loading bug for the Chapter 7 intro vignette</li>
                <li>Fixed rare division by 0 which caused the player speed to be NaN, resulting in a crash when wall-jumping</li>
                <li>Fixed <spoiler>Madeline's hair being the wrong color</spoiler> on the Mountain Overworld when you exit Chapter 7, The Epilogue, or Chapter 8</li>
            </ul>

            <br /><br />

                <li>Prevented a lame unintentional skip in the last level of Chapter 7 <spoiler>C-Side</spoiler></li>
                <li>Fixed some camera issues in Chapter 2 <spoiler>C-Side</spoiler></li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Previously, Madeline’s x-axis launch speed was multiplied by 1.2 if her x-axis input was neutral or in the same direction as the launch at the moment of impact. </li>
                    <li>Neutral inputs will no longer grant the launch speed bonus. X-axis input must now be in the same direction as the launch at the moment of impact.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
